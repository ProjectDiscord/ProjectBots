# ProjectBots ‚Äì Discord Bot List

**Note:** ProjectBots was previously discontinued (as of 09/26/2023), but it has now been revived as a hobby project under **ProjectDiscord**.

## Introduction

Welcome to **ProjectBots**, a Discord bot list platform built to help server owners discover, showcase, and share the best bots for their communities. Originally known as **DiscoBots**, the project has been rebranded and relaunched as part of **ProjectDiscord**.

This is currently a **hobby project**, meaning features and updates may come gradually, but our goal is to create a simple, modern, and community-driven bot listing experience.
